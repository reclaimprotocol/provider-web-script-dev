/// This file is used to introduce a mock implementation of the inapp sdk's web script environment.
/// It is not real and can be used to test your provider script with mock data.

/// The inapp sdk's mock APIs should already be available when making a development build, no need to re-define them.
/// This file should be used to modify them or add any other api/objects as needed for your development & testing.
/// You can modify the mock data and api implementations below as required.

/**
 * Update the mock api implementation below
 * For example:
 *
 * window.Reclaim.provider = {
 *   name: "Stub Provider",
 *   description: "Stub Provider Description",
 *   loginUrl: "https://example.com/",
 *   userAgent: {
 *     android: null,
 *     ios: null,
 *   },
 * };
